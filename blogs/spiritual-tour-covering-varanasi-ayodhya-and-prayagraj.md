Why Varanasi, Ayodhya, and Prayagraj for a Spiritual Tour?
</h2>
<p>
            They form Uttar Pradesh's spiritual golden triangle:
              </p>
               <p className="mt-2">
                <strong>Varanasi - </strong> World's oldest continuously inhabited city with ghats, temples, and hallowed Ganga Aarti.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Ayodhya  - </strong> Birthplace of Lord Rama with newly renovated temples and an ancient cultural landscape.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Prayagraj - </strong> Famous for the Triveni Sangam, the union of rivers Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati, and one of the most pious sites of Hinduism.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2">Both of these places are a great mix of religion, history, and culture, suitable for a 7-day spiritual pilgrimage.
